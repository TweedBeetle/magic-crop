amount param for image.sobel

in atSize, don't carry around imageMatrix. Just keep track of all seams carved
and carve them out of the imageMatrix either at the very end or at every
caching. (requires Matrix2D.carveSeams method, also for Image.carveSeams).
Optimize Image.carveSeam

This enables Matrix2D's data type to become Int16List (?)
if we change dirs to not have negative values, even int8List should be possible
bounded by Energies clamping to range 0-255. Verify this energy range is so!

threaded execution of seam carving

change energy and dir matrices to int8 based?
